# Usage instructions for reinforcement-learning

# Linking to the Library:
# Use `find_package` to locate the libraries provided by reinforcement-learning.
# Example usage in CMake:

find_package(reinforcement-learning CONFIG REQUIRED)

target_link_libraries(my-target PRIVATE reinforcement-learning::rlclientlib)

# Using Executables:
# The package also provides executables that can be found in the following directory:
# `${VCPKG_ROOT}/installed/<triplet>/tools/reinforcement-learning/`
#
# Replace `<triplet>` with your target architecture (e.g., `x64-windows`, `x64-linux`).

# Example to locate the vw:
find_program(VW_EXECUTABLE vw
    PATHS ${VCPKG_ROOT}/installed/${VCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET}/tools/reinforcement-learning
)

if(NOT VW_EXECUTABLE)
    message(FATAL_ERROR "my-package tool executable not found.")
endif()

# Example to locate the rl_sim_cpp:
find_program(RL_SIM_EXECUTABLE rl_sim_cpp
    PATHS ${VCPKG_ROOT}/installed/${VCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET}/tools/reinforcement-learning
)

if(NOT RL_SIM_EXECUTABLE)
    message(FATAL_ERROR "my-package tool executable not found.")
endif()
